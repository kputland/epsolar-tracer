===================================================
![Img](img/epsolar_tracer_bn.jpg)

This is the second generation of the EPsolar Tracer solar charge controller. 
You need RS-485 adapter for communication. The first generation controller 
used RS-232 and a different protocol. see https://github.com/xxv/tracer.
